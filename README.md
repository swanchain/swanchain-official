## Installation dependency

Run `npm install` to generate component.

## Development server

Run `npm run serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

```shell
 ERROR  Failed to compile with 1 error       
 error  in ./node_modules/@intlify/core-base/dist/core-base.mjs
 ...
 ...
 ```
 Run `npm i vue-i18n@9.1.0` to reinstall the components.

## Build project

```shell
# Build test projects
$ npm run build:testnet_t / npm run build:testnet_u / npm run build:testnet

# Build production projects
$ npm run build:prod_t / npm run build:prod_u / npm run build:prod
# You can use the npm run build command without any suffix if you are using a version of Node lower than 16, or you should use the command with the suffix name if you are using a version higher than 16
# The only difference between _t and _u is that _t uses the set keyword while _u uses the export keyword, and how you use it depends on which keyword your system supports.
```

The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist_prod/dist_testnet` directory.
